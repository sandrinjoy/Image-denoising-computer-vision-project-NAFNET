## Denoising Images


#### This is a cloned repo of NAFNET for denoising images. We used this repo setup for our computer vision project.


Our main is present in demo.ipynb file as well as demo_batch_128__resize_64.ipynb.

As well as the outputs of the model , denoising_autoencoder.pth, loss_curve.png, noise_types_comparison.png.

Rest of the files are part of NAFNET repo and we tried few experiments with the code so the resulting outputs are also present in this repo.
